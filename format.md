# `format` Set Command Window output display format

A Stack Overflow [answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/24593139/633083) suggests a near replacement was possible to implement in an earlier version of Julia but it appears not to work in either 0.6 or 0.7.

The [`Printf.@printf`](https://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/stdlib/Printf/#Printf.@printf) macro provides somewhat similar functionality.
