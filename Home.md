# MATLAB to Julia

The purpose of this wiki is to have a place to capture information that could be helpful for people interested in migrating code from MATLAB™ to Julia, and also those who are familiar with MATLAB and would like to learn Julia. It is meant to supplement existing resources, for instance the [differences](https://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/manual/noteworthy-differences/#Noteworthy-differences-from-MATLAB-1) page from the Julia documentation. However this wiki intends to be more comprehensive, and to be structured in such a way as to make it easy for one to find answers to questions like:

* For a given MATLAB or MATLAB toolbox command/function/construct what are the closest Julia equivalents?
* For a given MATLAB toolbox, what Julia packages provide similar functionality?

The organization mirrors that of the MATLAB product line; that is, the core MATLAB language features are together in the [[MATLAB]] section which if complete would map everything found in the core MATLAB [documentation](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/index.html) to Julia equivalents, while another section on the [[Control System Toolbox]], for instance, would map functionality documented in its [toolbox documentation page](https://www.mathworks.com/help/control/index.html) to Julia equivalents.

Of course, implicitly one can use the content of the wiki to map concepts in the other direction but the focus is on migration from MATLAB to Julia.
